          At DXT, we believe in doing things right â€” we focus on people as much as we focus on
          platforms, and we believe the right culture, mindset, and values are just as important as the
          technology itself.
          With over 40 years of combined experience, our team is driven by a shared goal: to bring
          meaningful change to the IT landscape. We're a team that values ethical choices, a
          collaborative culture, and partnerships that go beyond tran.
